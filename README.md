Share your knowledge on concepts and phenomena of data science & engineering.

#### Motivation
When taking MOOCs on data science and engineering, you can often encounter situations of being lost in all the topics and details, so we decided to combine students' efforts in organizing knowledge.

#### What's the use case?
The datadocs platform differs from other resources: Medium articles are usually lengthy and not fit for short attention spans; Google doesn't help much, because you need to know what to search for; and Wikipedia, let's be honest, is sometimes too hard to read. That's why we created a documentation platform where everyone can learn by writing. 

*This like a collaborative e-book for data enthusiasts.*

#### How it works?
The platform is based on [Facebook's Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). Docusarus is mainly used for quickly building documentation websites for software (such as React). But since any knowledge is some form of documentation, we repurposed it for our use case. The documentation is written in Markdown and deployed via Github Pages. Since datadocs is Open Source and hosted on Github, every Github user can create and edit pages, which makes the platform collaborative and allows for version control. Furthermore, we extended it to support search ([DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/)), math equations and comment section ([Disqus](https://disqus.com)). At the end, datadocs has become very powerful while remaining easy to use.

#### Current status
Currently, datadocs covers topics from the following courses:
- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) (deeplearning.ai, 2018)
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai) (fast.ai, 2019)
- [Open Machine Learning Course](https://mlcourse.ai) (mlcourse.ai, 2019)
- [Competitive Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science) (Coursera, 2019)
- [The Ultimate Hands-On Hadoop](https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-hands-on-hadoop-tame-your-big-data/) (Udemy, 2019)
- [Data Engineering Nanodegree Program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) (Udacity, 2019)

Since the project is new, we've got many reads but few writes, so feel free to contribute!
