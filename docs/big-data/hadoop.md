- Hadoop is an open-source platform for distributed storage and processing of very large datasets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware.
- It is fault tolerant, scalable, and extremely simple to expand.
- Data is too darn big - terabytes per day.
- Horizontal scaling is linear.
- Hadoop is written in Java and is supported on all major platforms.
