- Data model is an abstraction that organizes elements of data and how they will relate to each other.
- Data modeling is the process of creating data models for information systems.
- It can easily translate to database modeling, as this is the essential end state.
- Process to support business and user applications:
    - Gather requirements
    - Conceptual data modeling (entity mapping)
    - Logical data modeling (tables, schemas, columns)
    - Physical data modeling (DDLs)
- Data modeling is an important skill for anyone involved in the process of using and analyzing data.
- Does modeling is an iterative process:
    - It is iterative as new requirements and data are introduced.
    - Data engineers continually reorganize, restructure, and optimize data models to fit the needs.
    - Having flexibility will help.
- Data organization is critical:
    - Organized data determines later use.
    - Simple queries might become complicated if data modeling isn't well thought out.
    - Begin prior to building out application, business logic, and analytical models.
- Data modeling is more about how to structure data to be used by different stakeholders.
