Share your knowledge on concepts and phenomena of data science & engineering.

#### Motivation
When reading online resources and taking MOOCs on data science and engineering, you can often encounter situations of being lost in all the topics and details, so we decided to combine students' efforts in organizing knowledge.

#### How it works?
The website is based on [Facebook's Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). Docusaurus is mainly used for quickly building documentation websites for software (such as React). But since any knowledge is some form of documentation, we repurposed it for our use case. The documentation is written in Markdown and deployed via Github Pages. Since datadocs is Open Source and hosted on Github, every Github user can create and edit pages, which makes the project collaborative and allows for version control. Furthermore, we extended it to support search ([DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/)), math equations and comment section ([Disqus](https://disqus.com)). At the end, datadocs has become very powerful while remaining easy to use.
